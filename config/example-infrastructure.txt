# Segments are represented by mentioning a station with km-mark (separated by ;),
# the available track ids on this segment,
# and the end station with km-mark.
# The next segment starts with the last station again.
# When a different line is considered (i.e., the new segment should not start at the last station),
# leave a line containing only an &-character

# Segments that should be seen as one when obtaining headways and margins
# Separate the list of trafikplatser by ,-chars, then include a ;-char,
# and include the (relative) block-separations.
# 0-1 means that the whole section is one block,
# 0-1-2 means that there are two equal-sized blocks,
# 63.436-55.873-43.738 indicates two blocks that are not equal-sized (first smaller than last here)

# A list of conflicting transitions
# A station in the middle of a single-track line has a shorthand
# for generating the conflicts where simultaneous arrivals are allowed (parallel)
# or when they are not allowed (non-parallel)
# Each of those lines has (with ;-chars in between) the trafikplats, the type of arrivals
# and a pair of previous and next station (with ,-char in between)

# These transitions will be converted to full descriptions automatically
# The full ones consist of (separated by ;-signs) the trafikplats of the conflict,
# the type of conflict, the first movement and the second movement.
# Each movement consists of "from_tpl,tracks,to_tpl,tracks".
# One of the trafikplatser is the place of the conflict.
# The other is the direction the train comes from/goes to, together with segment tracks.
# Tracks are separated by a space.
# The rules will be converted automatically to a list where only one track is included everywhere.
# When all tracks at a tpl are included, the *-sign can be used.
